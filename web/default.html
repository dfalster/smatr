      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Linear models are often used in ecological

        and evolutionary studies. In particular scaling relationships of the form

        log Y = log <font face="Symbol" size="+1">a + B </font>log X have been

        used extensively in studies of:<br>

        1. Plant functional trait associations<br>

        2. Life history traits in relation to body size<br>

        3. Ecological stoichiometry </font></p>

      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In each case, hypotheses primarily concern

        the slope (B) and intercept (log <font face="Symbol" size="+1">a</font>)

        of a relationship rather than its strength. When one is interested in

        estimating a set of Y values from a set of X values, ordinary linear regression

        is the most appropriate method to use. If, however, the purpose is to

        describe the major axis along which two variables are correlated, regression

        is misleading because it systematically underestimates Y at one end and

        overestimates at the other, compared to the central axis of a cloud of

        points. This is because residuals from the &quot;line of best fit&quot;

        are calculated in the Y-dimension only. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">A more appropriate method in these situations is

  Standardised Major Axis (SMA, or reduced major axis, RMA) analysis. Unlike regression,

  residuals for the SMA &quot;line of best fit&quot; are calculated in both the

  X and Y dimensions. Until recently, a major limitation to research in the area

  has been the lack of statistical algorithms and software that provide for rigorous

  comparison of SMA lines among groups of data.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">(S)MATR is a software program designed for making

  statistical comparisons of SMA relationships among groups of data. For example,

  the relationship between two functional traits can be compared among groups

  of species from different locations. The software makes use of recently derived

  statistical algorithms to test for a common slope among groups, and test for

  differences in elevations among groups with a common slope. In addition, (S)MATR

  can be used to fit SMA relationships to individual groups and compare the slope

  of these relationships to a hypothesised value.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">System requirements:</font></b><font face="Comic Sans MS">

  (S)MATR is a simple DOS-based program that will run in any PC Windows environment.

  There are no minimum memory requirements, however, the program will naturally

  run faster on faster computers. Computer speed may be an issue if you are working

  with large datasets.</font></p>
